What Is This?

    wxBasic is a Basic interpreter along the lines of QBasic. It
    uses the wxWindows library to provide GUI controls. Since
    wxWindows is cross platform, it is hoped that some day wxBasic
    will be, too. For now, it is limited to the Windows platform.

    Look in the LOG file to see what's new in this release.
