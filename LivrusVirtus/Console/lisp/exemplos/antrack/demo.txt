change train       Change any of the values of an existing train.

book seat          The program asks for a customer's last and first name,
                   and then puts him/her on the specified train's seating
                   list.  The customer is also added to the customer list
                   if not already there.  If already there, add 1 to the
                   frequent rider field.  If is 10, then reduce train fare
                   by 50%, and reset frequent rider field to 0.

unbook seat        Take a customer off a particular train, but not off
                   the customer list.

list customers     Print out all customers on the customer list.

list trains        Print out all the trains.

list riders 211    Print out all the customers on a particular train,
                   trains are identified by a number, and the number of
                   the train is 211 in this example.

help               Print out this help message.

quit               Quit the program, loses all the information!
