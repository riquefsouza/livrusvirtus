                          HOW TO USE PROLOG AT CANISIUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to start C-Prolog on the SUNS:

    % prolog

The prompt is ?-

To exit, type CONTROL-D.
                                 ----+----

If the Prolog program gets caught in an infinite loop, type CONTROL-C and you
will get a prompt.  Type "a" and press RETURN to get back to the main ?-
prompt.
                                 ----+----

If you need to temporarily escape to UNIX, do:

    system("ls").
    system("csh").
                                 ----+----

To enter facts and rules from the terminal, first type (after the prompt)
the symbols [user] followed by a period:  (MAKE SURE NOT TO FORGET THE PERIOD!)

    ?- [user].

Then the prompt changes to a vertical bar.  Type in 1 or more facts or
rules (each ends in a period).  When done, type CONTROL-D.  This puts you
back in query mode, and the prompt changes to ?- again.

To load facts and rules from a file, put the file's name in the square
brackets.  You can load more than one such file:

    ?- [queenvic].

Again, don't forget the period!  Double quotes are not needed.  If the name of
the file has one or more slashes in it (as it would if it included a UNIX 
pathname), enclose the whole thing in single quotes.

    ?- ['/mnt1/dept/meyer/PROLOG/xxx'].

                                 ----+----

To see the current database of facts and rules, type

    ?- listing.

Make sure to put a period after every clause!!!  Prolog will wait for you
to type in a period if you forget one.  Do not be alarmed at how Prolog
renames your variables as underscores followed by numbers.  This is 
unavoidable, given the way that Prolog operates.

You can also list the facts and rules pertaining to a particular functor:

    listing(bird).
                                 ----+----

The facts and rules may include comments, and in fact, files should have
comments.  They are anything inside C-style comment markers: /* and */.  
Comments may span multiple lines.

    /*  This is a
       comment !*/

                                 ----+----

If you want a trace of all the backtracking as your program executes,
type:

      trace.

(Always note the period.)  Then enter your expression to be evaluated
and every time it says CALL ? just press RETURN.

To turn off tracing, do

      untrace.

                                 ----+----
