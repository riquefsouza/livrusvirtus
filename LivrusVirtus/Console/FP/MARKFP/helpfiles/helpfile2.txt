                            FP functional forms
                            -------------------

.                 composition, compose two functions

#                 constant, return the thing given after #, not the data

[ , ]             construction, apply all these functions to the same data

@                 apply to all, apply this one function all elements in a list

/                 insertion, put this function between each element in the list

condition         make a decision between 2 functions

def               define a function
