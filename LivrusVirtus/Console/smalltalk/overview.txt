1.  What is Smalltalk?
----------------------

     Smalltalk is a general purpose high level programming language.  It is the
     original "pure" object oriented language, although it was not the first to
     use the object concept (that was Simula 67).

2.  How does Smalltalk differ from C++?
---------------------------------------

     Smalltalk is a pure OOP language, whereas C++ is a hybrid, that is a cross
     between the traditional C language and the objects concept.  You can use
     C++ with little attention to classes, and in fact some people use it merely
     as a better C, since it has a number of clever extensions (like "VAR"
     parameters.)  However, Smalltalk can only be used in an object oriented
     fashion.

3.  What are Smalltalk's weaknesses?
-------------------------------

     Smalltalk is an interpreted language, so its programs run slowly.

     Smalltalk, as a language, does not have strong typing so some programming
     errors cannot be caught easily without using a debugger at run-time.  This
     is in sharp contract to C++ and Ada9X, both of which have strong type
     checking.

     But perhaps the worst thing about Smalltalk is that it is so different
     from imperative languages, so the object paradigm must be swallowed whole
     and at the outset.  New programmers may find it fun and easy to learn, but
     hardened programmers will rail against what seem to be idiotic differences
     between a pure OOP language and more traditional variabled-oriented 
     languages.  Perhaps this is why C++ is so much more used and admired, 
     because it admits a graceful movement into the OOP environment.

     Smalltalk never really took off as a production language, but its devotees
     are many and are not likely to give up.  It will undoubtedly continue to
     influence future programming languages.

4.  Reference Books
-------------------

     "Smalltalk-80 : the language and its implementation" by Adele Goldberg 
          and David Robson, Addison-Wesley, 1983.

      Bouwhuis call no. QA76.8.S635 G64 1983

     This is the standard book on Smalltalk which acts as both a tutorial,
     programming language reference manual and an explanation as to how 
     Smalltalk is implemented.  At 700 pages, it is quite massive!

     There are many other books about Smalltalk out there, although we have
     none other in Bouwhuis.  Many books on programming language theory have
     sections on Smalltalk.


5.  How do we use Smalltalk here at Canisius?
---------------------------------------------

     We have a version of Smalltalk called GNU Smalltalk 1.1.1.  It can be
     run under UNIX with no special graphics interface needed, although it does
     have an interface to X Windows.
