MySQL And dbExpress 

Once you’ve installed MySQL 3.23.52, the first thing you need to do in Delphi is test your connection from dbExpress. The TSQLConnection component has a default MySQLConnection value for the Connection property. However, we must still change a number of properties before it works right. After you’ve selected MySQLConnection, the LibraryName gets set to dbexpmys.dll, which is the dbExpress MySQL driver for MySQL version 3.22.x. Since we’re using a higher version number 3.23.x we must explicitly change that property value from dbexpmys.dll to dbexpmysql.dll otherwise it won’t work (symptoms if you continue to use the ‘old’ DLL with version 3.23.x include the fact that you will not see table names, can only access the first 10 fields of records, and get frequent access violations). 

Apart from the LibraryName, we must also take a look at the VendorLib which gets set to LIBMYSQL.dll. Unfortunately, after you install MySQL, this DLL is not added to the search path. It can be found in c:\MySQL\bin, and you can either add c:\MySQL\bin to the search path, or copy the MySQL.dll somewhere in the path, like the WinNT\System32 directory. A third alternative consists of using a hardcoded c:\mysql\bin\ LIBMYSQL.dll property value. Finally, you may want to edit the Connection properties to specify the correct database to connect to (see Figure 2).
