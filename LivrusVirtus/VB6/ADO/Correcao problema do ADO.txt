Hi all
I am referencing Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.5 library.
My form has a Command Button which moves to the next record. But when it reaches the next i.e EOF i get error(see title)
The code is below:
Public cnNotes as Connection
Public rsNotes as Recordset

Private Sub_Form_Load()
set cnNotes = New Connection
With cnNotes
.Connection String
.Open
End with

Set rsNotes = New Recordset
rsNotes.Open"Select * from Notes ",cnNotes,adOpenDynamic,adLockOptimistic


Text1.Text = rsNotes("Text")


end Sub

Private Sub Command1_Click()

If Not rsNotes.eof then
rsNotes.MoveNext
text1.text = rsNotes("Text")

End if

----------------
CORRECAO
----------------

Public cnNotes as Connection
Public rsNotes as Recordset

Private Sub_Form_Load()
set cnNotes = New Connection
With cnNotes
.Connection String
.Open
End with

Set rsNotes = New Recordset
rsNotes.Open"Select * from Notes ",cnNotes,adOpenDynamic,adLockOptimistic

If Not rsNotes.eof then 'Check here too as the error will start prompt out if no records are selected
   Text1.Text = rsNotes("Text")
end if

end Sub

Private Sub Command1_Click()

if cnNotes  is nothing then exit sub

If Not rsNotes.eof then
  rsNotes.MoveNext
  text1.text = rsNotes("Text")
Else
  rsNotes.MoveLast
End if

End Sub
		 

 Private Sub Command1_Click()
    If Not rsNotes.eof then
      rsNotes.MoveNext
      If Not rsNotes.eof
        text1.text = rsNotes("Text")
      else
        (bonus slick trick)
        rsNotes.movefirst
        Msgbox "starting at beginning"..... (this could be an option with vbyesno msg)
      endif
    End if
  End Sub
